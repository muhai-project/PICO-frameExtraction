<SUMMARY_BODY MODIFIED="2013-11-01 15:09:45 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Psychotic depression is a severe depression with psychotic features (i.e. delusions and/or hallucinations). Uncertainty surrounds the most effective drug treatment for psychotic depression: with an antidepressant alone, with an antipsychotic alone or with the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic.</P>
<P>The aim of this review is to compare the efficacy of the various forms of drug treatment that have been used to treat psychotic depression. We did this by analysing all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated drug treatments for psychotic depression. We searched for these trials in a wide-ranging way. The search identified 3659 studies, but in the end, we found only 12 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. These trials involved a total of 929 people.</P>
<P>From these trials, we found evidence that the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic provides more effective treatment for psychotic depression than either treatment alone. However, our confidence in this conclusion is limited because the information came from only a small number of RCTs, which included small numbers of people. In addition, the types of people involved varied between RCTs, and the RCTs differed in design, which means that we cannot confidently generalise their findings.</P>

<P>A search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group Register (CCDANCTR) was carried out (to 12 April 2013). These registers include reports of randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: EMBASE (1970-), MEDLINE (1950-) and PsycINFO (1960-). Reference lists of all studies and related reviews were screened and key authors contacted.</P>

<P>Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias in the included studies, according to the criteria of the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I>. Data were entered into RevMan 5.1. We used intention-to-treat data. For dichotomous efficacy outcomes, the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated. For continuously distributed outcomes, it was not possible to extract data from the RCTs. Regarding the primary outcome of harm, only overall dropout rates were available for all studies.</P>

<P>The search identified 3659 abstracts, but only 12 RCTs with a total of 929 participants could be included in the review. Because of clinical heterogeneity, few meta-analyses were possible. The main outcome was reduction of severity (response) of depression, not of psychosis.</P>
<P>We found no evidence for the efficacy of monotherapy with an antidepressant or an antipsychotic.</P>
<P>However, evidence suggests that the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic is more effective than antidepressant monotherapy (three RCTs; RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.98, P = 0.006), more effective than antipsychotic monotherapy (four RCTs; RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.38, P = 0.00001) and more effective than placebo (two identical RCTs; RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.82, P = 0.003).</P>
<P>Risk of bias is considerable: there were differences between studies with regard to diagnosis, uncertainties around randomisation and allocation concealment, differences in treatment interventions (pharmacological differences between the various antidepressants and antipsychotics) and different outcome criteria.</P>

<P>Psychotic depression is heavily understudied, limiting confidence in the conclusions drawn.

<CONDITION MODIFIED="2013-10-31 02:26:24 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne ">
<P>Psychotic depression is a severe condition that is defined as a depressive episode with psychotic features (i.e. delusions and/or hallucinations) in the context of a (unipolar) major depressive disorder. Psychotic depression is not uncommon. In the US Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study (<LINK REF="REF-Johnson--1991" TYPE="REFERENCE">Johnson 1991</LINK>), 14% of participants who met the criteria for major depression had a history of episodes with psychotic features. In a European general population study, 18.5% of respondents with a major depressive episode had psychotic features; the prevalence of psychotic depression was 0.4% and of non-psychotic depression 2.0% (<LINK REF="REF-Ohayon-2002" TYPE="REFERENCE">Ohayon 2002</LINK>). In a US study of hospitalised participants with major depression, 25% met the criteria for psychotic depression (<LINK REF="REF-Coryell-1984" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coryell 1984</LINK>). Compared with non-psychotic depression, psychotic depression is marked by greater severity, increased incapacity, a lower likelihood of placebo response, longer duration of episodes and recurrence of psychotic features in subsequent episodes (<LINK REF="REF-Coryell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coryell 1998</LINK>).</P>
</CONDITION>
<INTERVENTION MODIFIED="2013-11-03 15:07:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>) recommend electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or pharmacotherapy as treatment for psychotic depression. Pharmacotherapy for psychotic depression could consist of an antipsychotic, an antidepressant or a combination of both. Most guidelines recommend treatment that combines an antidepressant with an antipsychotic (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>. However, discussion continues regarding whether the combination of an antipsychotic plus an antidepressant is more effective than monotherapy with an antidepressant or an antipsychotic ( <LINK REF="REF-Dutch-Guideline-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dutch Guideline 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Mahli-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Mahli 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Parker-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 1992</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wijkstra-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijkstra 2005</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Wijkstra-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijkstra 2007</LINK>). The intervention studied in this review is pharmacological treatment for psychotic depression, especially the question of whether the combination of an antipsychotic plus an antidepressant is more effective than either treatment given as monotherapy.</P>
</INTERVENTION>
<THEORY MODIFIED="2013-11-01 02:15:33 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>All antidepressants enhance the activity of serotonin and/or noradrenaline, and some of them (also) dopamine (<LINK REF="REF-Sadock-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadock 2009</LINK>). Most antidepressants achieve this via inhibition of reuptake of these neurotransmitters in the presynaptic neuron (tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)), although some antidepressants have other working mechanisms (e.g. blockade of postsynaptic serotonin-2 receptors such as mirtazapine or inhibition of their breakdown via inhibition of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAOIs)). Nevertheless, their noradrenergic and serotonergic effects do not completely explain their efficacy, as these effects occur already within hours after first intake, but it takes days to weeks before antidepressants begin to exert their effects in participants with depression or anxiety (<LINK REF="REF-Sadock-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadock 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Almost all antipsychotics (classical as well as atypical antipsychotics, with the exception of clozapine) are blockers of the postsynaptic dopamine-2 receptor, and their therapeutic efficacy is correlated with their affinity for dopamine-2 receptors in vivo. However, other effects may contribute to their efficacy, such as their affinity for presynaptic serotonin-1 receptors, postsynaptic serotonin-2 receptors and histamine receptors, as can be seen with some atypical antipsychotics (e.g. olanzapine and quetiapine). Similar to the antidepressants, these effects do not completely explain their efficacy because they also occur already within hours after first intake, but it takes days to weeks for antipsychotics to begin to work (<LINK REF="REF-Sadock-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sadock 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>The traditional view is that antidepressants work against depression and antipsychotics work against psychosis. Therefore, it seems appropriate in psychotic depression to treat the psychotic symptoms with an antipsychotic and the depressive symptoms with an antidepressant. However, when psychotic depression is considered as the most severe form of depression, and when psychosis is viewed as the distal consequence of that severity (as is the case in the <I>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR);</I> <LINK REF="REF-APA-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2000</LINK>), treatment with an antidepressant alone seems logical. On the other hand, treatment with an antipsychotic alone, especially one of the newer atypical antipsychotics with possibly antidepressant effects, cannot be ruled out.</P>
</THEORY>
<IMPORTANCE MODIFIED="2013-11-03 15:07:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Clinical practise is characterised by uncertainty as to whether it is most appropriate to start treatment in this patient group with antidepressant monotherapy or with the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic because of the potential adverse effects of antipsychotics (especially extrapyramidal side effects, hyperprolactinaemia and the risk of metabolic syndrome, including weight gain). A previous meta-analysis did not find a statistically significant difference between TCA monotherapy and combination therapy (<LINK REF="REF-Parker-1992" TYPE="REFERENCE">Parker 1992</LINK>). However, the findings and conclusions of that meta-analysis were limited by the inadequate methodology of many of the included studies, which were often retrospective, uncontrolled and/or not randomised. Some international guidelines on the pharmacological treatment of psychotic depression (in the United States: <LINK REF="REF-Nelson-1997" TYPE="REFERENCE">Nelson 1997</LINK>; in the Netherlands: <LINK REF="REF-Dutch-Guideline-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dutch Guideline 2009</LINK>) and those presented in reviews (<LINK REF="REF-Wheeler-2000" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wheeler 2000</LINK>) suggest that one may consider TCA monotherapy before adding an antipsychotic. However, in contrast, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients with Major Depressive Disorder (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2010</LINK>) and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (<LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>) recommend initial combination therapy. The same recommendation is made in a review by Coryell (<LINK REF="REF-Coryell-1998" TYPE="REFERENCE">Coryell 1998</LINK>). This variation between guidelines reflects the limited evidence on which these guidelines are based. In a review about evidence used in practice guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-Wijkstra-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijkstra 2007</LINK>), we concluded that physicians (and patients) should be aware that guidelines for treatment recommendations may be less evidence-based than asserted, even when it is stated that treatment recommendations are based on the highest level of evidence.</P>
<P>Treatment with a classical antipsychotic alone is not recommended, primarily because of the findings of a study by Spiker (<LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>), in which treatment with perphenazine alone was less effective than treatment with perphenazine plus amitriptyline. However, the atypical antipsychotics may be worth reconsidering now because of the reduced risk of extrapyramidal side effects and potential antidepressant properties of some of the atypical antipsychotics (<LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>).</P>
<P>This review is an update of our Cochrane review first published in 2005 (<LINK REF="REF-Wijkstra-2005" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijkstra 2005</LINK>). Our conclusion in 2005 was as follows: ''Treatment with an antipsychotic alone is not a good option. Starting with the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, as well as starting with an antidepressant alone and adding an antipsychotic if the patient does not respond, both appear to be appropriate options for patients with psychotic depression.''</P>
<P>Since 2005, a few more studies have been conducted, leading to a different conclusion regarding treatment with an antidepressant alone or with the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic.</P>
<P>Another important clinical issue is that differences in response to specific treatments may be explained in relation to non-response to prior treatment(s). Generalising from observations across medical disciplines, it would be expected that patients who did not respond to an adequate treatment will respond less to subsequent treatment. Some data are available on this topic with regard to pharmacological treatment of major depressive disorder (<LINK REF="REF-Sackeim-2001" TYPE="REFERENCE">Sackeim 2001</LINK>). Two studies (<LINK REF="REF-Prudic-1990" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prudic 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-Prudic-1996" TYPE="REFERENCE">Prudic 1996</LINK>) showed that a greater degree of treatment resistance predicts an inferior response to ECT.</P>

<B>CCDAN's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR)</B>
</P>
<P>The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group (CCDAN) maintains two clinical trials registers at its editorial base in Bristol, UK; a references register and a studies-based register. The CCDANCTR-References Register contains over 31,500 reports of trials in depression, anxiety and neurosis. Approximately 65% of these references have been tagged to individual, coded trials. The coded trials are held in the CCDANCTR-Studies Register and records are linked between the two registers through the use of unique Study ID tags. Coding of trials is based on the EU-Psi coding manual. Reports of trials for inclusion in the Group's registers are collated from routine (weekly), generic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO; quarterly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and review specific searches of additional databases. Reports of trials are also sourced from international trials registers c/o the World Health Organization&#8217;s trials portal (<A HREF="http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/">ICTRP</A>), drug companies, and the handsearching of key journals, conference proceedings and other (non-Cochrane) systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Details of <A HREF="http://ccdan.cochrane.org/search-strategies-identification-studies">CCDAN's generic search strategies</A> can be found on the Group's website.</P>

Working independently, JW and JL assessed risk of bias of included studies using the tool described in the <I>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</I> (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). The following items were assessed.</P>

<UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS MODIFIED="2013-11-01 12:18:27 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne ">
<P>We identified neither cluster-randomised nor cross-over trials. However, if found, we would not have included them in our review, as we were interested in differences not between clusters (e.g. clinics) but between drugs or classes of drugs; nor were we interested in the results of a cross-over phase, as the outcome of the first phase might have had an impact on the outcome of the second (i.e. cross-over) phase.</P>
<P>In case a study had multiple intervention groups, only the data for the pairwise comparison in question were included. Further, if a study compared two or more medications of the same type (e.g. venlafaxine and imipramine), data were combined into a single category, for example, the category 'antidepressant'.</P>
</UNIT_OF_ANALYSIS>
<MISSING_DATA MODIFIED="2013-11-01 15:11:26 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We used intention-to-treat (ITT) response data in the analyses, as ITT data are less biased and because they address a more pragmatic and clinically relevant question (<LINK REF="REF-Higgins-2011" TYPE="REFERENCE">Higgins 2011</LINK>). When necessary, we converted response data from the trials into ITT response data by using the total number of randomly assigned participants per group that had started with treatment as the denominator. So participants who had started with medication but were withdrawn before endpoint were assumed not to have experienced response.</P>
<P>When data were missing, we contacted the study authors to request the required data.</P>
<P>No other imputation techniques were used to deal with missing data.</P>
</MISSING_DATA>
<HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-11-01 15:11:37 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne ">
<P>First, we evaluated whether clinical homogeneity could be assumed by evaluating any between-study dissimilarities regarding participants, interventions and outcome measures. Studies that were considered to threaten the clinical homogeneity assumption were excluded from the meta-analysis.</P>
<P>The I<SUP>2</SUP> statistic supplied with a 95% CI was used to assess the magnitude of statistical heterogeneity when values exceeding 0.40 were considered possibly relevant. We did not perform the Q test to determine heterogeneity because of its low power in our meta-analysis resulting from the low numbers of studies in all of our comparisons.</P>
<P>Pre-stated subgroup analyses were planned to explore sources of any heterogeneity. No meta-regression was performed.<BR/>
</P>
</HETEROGENEITY_ASSESSMENT>
<BIAS_ASSESSMENT MODIFIED="2013-11-03 14:56:25 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>When data from at least 10 studies became available, the presence of publication bias was assessed using contour-enhanced funnel plots in which treatment effects expressed as RR (Relative Risk) from individual studies were plotted against each study's sample size. We did not perform Egger's regression test in view of low statistical power in our meta-analyses, again resulting from the low number of studies included.</P>
<P>It must be noted that asymmetry of funnel plots does not necessarily indicate publication bias but may result from other biases such as inflated results in smaller studies due to poorer methodological quality, or true heterogeneity.</P>

<DATA_SYNTHESIS MODIFIED="2013-11-01 15:11:46 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>We primarily used the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method to calculate pooled risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Risk ratios are preferred over odds ratios because of their more straight-forward interpretation (i.e. the number of times the outcome is more likely to occur given one treatment over another).</P>
<P>In cases in which evidence of statistical heterogeneity was found, we used DerSimonian and Laird's random-effects models (<LINK REF="REF-DerSimonian-1986" TYPE="REFERENCE">DerSimonian 1986</LINK>).</P>

<P>In 2004 from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) search, we identified 1782 publications: in the searches in MEDLINE 720 and in EMBASE 831; in total, 3333. With some overlap from 2004, we have since found an additional 326 publications. The first step of screening the abstracts of these publications in 2004 resulted in 798 relevant publications (749 from CENTRAL, 38 from MEDLINE and 11 from EMBASE); in 2011, we found 40 additional studies (three from CENTRAL, 32 from CCDANCTR-References Register and 5 from CCDANCTR-Studies Register). The second step of screening the full articles of these publications in 2004 resulted in the identification of 52 publications (47, three and two respectively) and now 17 (one from CENTRAL, 13 from CCDANCTR-References Register and three from CCDANCTR-Studies Register). In 2004, handsearching of reference lists from relevant reviews resulted in the identification of one other publication (<LINK REF="STD-Bellini-1994" TYPE="STUDY">Bellini 1994</LINK>), and handsearching of the included publications did not lead to identification of any further relevant publications. Now, this resulted in no publications. In 2004, the final fourth step of reviewing these 53 publications resulted in seven included studies, and in 2004 we added two other publications, which we knew were in press: one by van den Broek (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Broek-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Broek 2004a</LINK>) and one reporting two similar trials (<LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>). Thus, in 2004 in total, nine publications with 10 RCTs were included. Now, in the fourth step, by reviewing 17 publications, we found two additional studies to be included.</P>
<P>In additional searches on the CCDANCTR and CENTRAL (December 2011 to April 2013), we found another 288 references. Of these 288 references, we did not find any other publication to include.</P>
<P>So, taking together both searches, we found 3974 publications through the electronic search strategies, from which we finally included 11 publications with 12 RCTs (see <LINK REF="FIG-03" TYPE="FIGURE">Figure 3</LINK>).</P>
<P>In 2004, 13 studies needed a consensus discussion in the fourth step of the search strategy before they were excluded, and now five additional studies needed such a discussion before they were excluded, resulting in a total of 18 excluded studies (see <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Participants</HEADING>
<P>All participants fulfilled criteria for major depressive disorder with psychotic features, classified according to a formal classification system (RDC: Research Diagnostic Criteria, <I>DSM-III, DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR</I>). Six studies explicitly used a semi-structured diagnostic interview (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Broek-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Broek 2004a</LINK>: SADS: Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia; <LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK>: SADS; <LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK>: BPRS: Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>: SADS; <LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>: SCID IV: Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV; <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>: SCID IV).</P>
<P>Diagnostic procedures were different between the studies. In all studies, participants were diagnosed according to a formal classification system (RDC, <I>DSM-III, DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR</I>). Six studies explicitly used a semi-structured diagnostic interview (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Broek-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Broek 2004a</LINK>: SADS; <LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK>: SADS; <LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK>: BPRS; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>: SADS; <LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>: SCID IV; <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>: SCID IV). These different procedures could have led to possible differences in participant categories.</P>
<P>Seven studies included only participants with unipolar psychotic depression. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 1996</LINK>, it was possible to exclude bipolar participants from the data. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Anton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 1990</LINK>, 15.8% (six out of thirty eight) bipolar participants were included in the data that the author used in his analysis. However, it was unclear how many of the eight dropouts, who were excluded before analysis, were bipolar participants. The author was not able to give additional information. Therefore, we decided to assume a random dropout rate. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>, 15.5% of participants were bipolar (<LINK REF="STD-Anton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>). In the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 2000</LINK>, we were able to exclude the bipolar participants with additional information provided by the authors.

In <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>, only participants with mood congruent delusions were included.

Antidepressant plus antipsychotic versus placebo was studied in one arm of both identical studies of Rothschild (<LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>): olanzapine (12.4 mg; respectively, 13.9 mg) plus fluoxetine (23.5 mg; respectively, 22.6 mg) versus placebo; treatment period was eight weeks.</P>
<P>7. Antidepressant plus antipsychotic versus placebo plus antidepressant was studied in four studies. In <LINK REF="STD-Anton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 1990</LINK>: amitriptyline (150 to 250 mg) plus perphenazine (24 to 40 mg) versus amoxapine (300 to 500 mg); treatment period was four weeks; in <LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK>: nortriptyline (mean 63 mg) plus perphenazine (mean 19 mg) versus nortriptyline (mean dose 76 mg); treatment started with nortriptyline, and once nortriptyline blood level was between 50 and 50 ng/mL, random assignment followed; treatment period with nortriptyline plus perphenazine (or placebo) after random assignment was 2 to 16 weeks (total treatment at least four weeks); in one arm of the study by <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>: amitriptyline (mean 170 mg; 18 to 128 ng/mL) plus perphenazine (mean 54 mg; 157 to 690 ng/mL) versus amitriptyline (mean 218 mg; 130 to 500 ng/mL); treatment period was four weeks; and in two arms of <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>: venlafaxine (375 mg) plus quetiapine (600 mg) versus imipramine (plasma levels imipramine plus its metabolite desmethylimipramine 200 to 300 ng/mL) and versus venlafaxine (375 mg); treatment period was 7 weeks.</P>
<P>8. Antidepressant plus antipsychotic versus placebo plus antipsychotic was the subject in three studies. In one arm of both identical studies of Rothschild (<LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>): olanzapine (12.4 mg; respectively, 13.9 mg) plus fluoxetine (23.5 mg; respectively, 22.6 mg) versus olanzapine (mean 11.9 mg; respectively, 14.0 mg); treatment period was eight weeks; in one arm of <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>: amitriptyline (mean 170 mg; 18 to 128 ng/mL) plus perphenazine (mean 54 mg; 157 to 690 ng/mL) versus perphenazine (mean dose 50 mg; blood level 19 to 113 ng/mL); treatment period was four weeks; and in <LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>, olanzapine (15 to 20 mg) plus sertraline (150 to 200 mg) versus olanzapine (15 to 20 mg); treatment period was 12 weeks.</P>
<P>Most of these studies had a washout period before the start of treatment or random assignment, varying from four to seven days. One study had a washout period of two weeks (<LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1988</LINK>). Because of the design of the study of <LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK> (all participants used nortriptyline before random assignment to additional perphenazine or placebo), this study was considered a trial without a washout period. The two trials <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK> had a 'screening period' of three to nine days, leaving unclear whether this was a period in which medication was not allowed. In <LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>, psychotropics were tapered before random assignment without a washout period. So, heterogeneity is seen in the medication-free period before treatment.</P>
<P>Dosage of psychotropics used in the different trials was considered reasonably adequate. However, differences in dosing strategies led to possible bias. In four studies re TCAs, doses were adjusted according to predefined therapeutic plasma levels (<LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Broek-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Broek 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>). In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>, dose adjustment was not based on plasma levels, but afterwards it was found that the plasma levels were therapeutic in most participants, although plasma levels of participants receiving TCAs alone were lower compared with those of participants receiving TCA plus antipsychotic. In the two other trials with TCAs, no plasma levels were determined. Dosages in the <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1988</LINK> study were at least 150 mg/d, but only during three of the four study weeks. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Anton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 1990</LINK>, participants received at least 150 mg/d from the third day of the four-week study period. Amitriptyline 150 mg/d is in the low range of an adequate dosage. In the studies of <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Broek-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van den Broek 2004</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK>, SSRIs (fluvoxamine and mirtazapine) were dosed according to predefined plasma levels. Fixed doses were used in the studies of Zanardi (<LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 2000</LINK>): sertraline 150 mg, paroxetine 50 mg, venlafaxine 300 mg and fluvoxamine 300 mg. In the studies of Rothschild (<LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>), doses were clinically adjusted: olanzapine 5 to 20 mg and fluoxetine 20 to 80 mg.</P>
<P>Differences in additional medication strategies were also noted. In most studies, additional medication was used, such as benzodiazepines (flurazepam up to 30 mg or lorazepam as needed) and anticholinergics. In the studies of <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Broek-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Broek 2004a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK>, some participants were treated with additional haloperidol, if clinically needed. With information provided by the authors, we were able to identify these participants in the results, and we counted them as dropouts, as in these studies the focus was the comparison of two antidepressants.</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Outcomes</HEADING>
<P>The primary efficacy outcome was the response rate in each study. It was not possible to transfer the authors' defined response data into rates based on one definition (i.e. at least 50% reduction of the HRSD score). Some authors used response definitions based on what is often considered remission. In addition, some authors included psychotic symptoms in their response definition. In the absence of a better option, we decided to use the response data as reported by the authors.</P>
<P>Differences in outcome measures were noted. In most trials, the HRSD was used as an outcome measure. However, different versions of the HRSD were used, and the authors used different definitions of response. In six trials, the response definition was a reduction of at least 50% of the HRSD score compared with baseline (<LINK REF="STD-Anton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Broek-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van den Broek 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>). In four studies, the authors' definition of response was actually comparable with a frequently used definition of remission (<LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 2000</LINK>).</P>
<P>In five studies, the response definition also includes psychotic symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 2000</LINK>). <LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Broek-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Broek 2004a</LINK> used a response criterion of HRSD-17 &lt; 50%; <LINK REF="STD-Anton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 1990</LINK> &#8804; 50%; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK> HRSD-24 &lt; 50%; <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK> &lt; 50% plus &lt; 15; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK> HRSD-17 &lt; 7 and no delusions; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1988</LINK> HRSD-17 &lt; 7 and not psychotic, or HRSD-17 6.5 to 9.5 and not psychotic and a third less of entering score; and <LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK> HRSD-17 &lt; 11 and BPRS score of the items 11, 12 and 15 of 1 or 2 (i.e. not psychotic). In <LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>, remission was defined as HRSD-17 score &lt; 11 and no psychosis; <LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 1996</LINK> HRSD-21 &lt; 8 and DDERS (Dimensions of Delusional Experience Rating Scale) = 0; and <LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 2000</LINK> HRSD-21 &lt; 9 and DDERS = 0. In the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 1996</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 2000</LINK>, no minimum HRSD score was applied as an inclusion criterion.</P>
<P>In addition to response rates based on the above criteria used by study authors, several studies reported remission rates separately (<LINK REF="REF-van-den-Broek-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Broek 2004a</LINK>: HRSD-17 &lt; 8, <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>: HAMD-24 &lt; 9 for two consecutive visits, <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>: HRSD-17 &lt; 8). In two studies, the authors' definition of response is the same as what is nowadays considered the definition of remission (<LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1988</LINK>: HRSD-17 &lt; 7).</P>

<HEADING LEVEL="4">Dropout rates</HEADING>
<P>Overall dropout rates for the primary outcome were available for all studies. Dropout rates due to adverse effects were available for six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Anton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Broek-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Broek 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>). Dropout rates due to adverse effects were not based on ITT analysis for three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>); were unavailable for one study (<LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1988</LINK>); and were the same as the overall dropout rates for two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 2000</LINK>). Dropouts specifically due to mortality or suicide were not reported, so we decided to extract only overall dropout rates.</P>
<P>The overall dropout rates for the studies varied from 9% to 45%. In the <LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK> study, the reported dropout rate was 10%. However, when haloperidol-treated participants were included as dropouts, as was our approach, the dropout rate was 40%. In the two multicenter trials with olanzapine/fluoxetine (<LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>), dropout rates were 41%, and even higher non-completion rates (56%) were reported. Mostly, no statistically significant differences in overall dropout rates were noted between any of the treatments, neither in individual studies nor after pooling of studies.</P>

<P>The <LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK> study provided information on prior treatment of the current episode. However, these data were not available for the subgroup with psychotic depression. In <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>, some data about prior treatment are available.

<P>The primary efficacy outcome was the response rate (of depression). It was not possible to transfer the authors' defined response data into rates based on a single definition (i.e. 50% reduction of the HRSD score). Some authors used response definitions based on what is often considered remission (e.g. HAMD &lt; 8 or 10), and some authors included psychotic symptoms in their response definition. In the absence of a better option, we decided to use response data as reported by the authors, with the preference to use response of depression rather than response of psychosis.</P>
<P>In eight of the 12 studies, we recalculated intention-to-treat response rates using all randomly assigned participants as the denominator. Of 46 participants in the study of <LINK REF="STD-Anton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 1990</LINK>, eight were dropped from the study before receiving two full weeks of active medication. These participants were excluded from the analysis by the author, but we included them in our ITT analysis. In the studies of <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Broek-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Broek 2004a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK>, we counted participants treated with haloperidol as dropouts because haloperidol treatment in these participants was started after random assignment, in part to keep them in the study. Thus, treatment with haloperidol is considered a potential bias with regard to the effect of study medication as well as dropout. <LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK> excluded six dropouts after random assignment to perphenazine or placebo. We included them in our ITT analysis. In the studies of <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK> and <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>, seven per cent and nine per cent, respectively, of randomly assigned participants were lost before baseline plus one visit. These participants were excluded from the study's analysis but were included in our ITT analysis. In both studies of Spiker (<LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1988</LINK>), seven dropouts were excluded from their analysis, but we included them in our ITT analysis.</P>
<P>For the secondary outcome of change in symptom severity, we decided to refrain from using continuous data from observer depression severity scales. In two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Broek-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van den Broek 2004</LINK>), continuous data were available for the total group (psychotic and non-psychotic) but not from the psychotic subgroup. In four studies, continuous data were not available (<LINK REF="STD-Anton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 1996</LINK>). In one study (<LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>), baseline and final mean HRSD data are given, but it was impossible to exclude bipolar participants from these data and convert the data to ITT data.

Pooling of data from the three remaining studies is useless because three different comparisons are studied: AD versus AD (<LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 2000</LINK>) with no ITT data; AD + AP versus AP (<LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>); and AD + AP versus AD (<LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>).</P>

<DISCUSSION MODIFIED="2015-07-09 13:42:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>Despite our extensive search of the literature (screening more than 3600 abstracts and 829 full articles, as well as carefully reviewing 69 publications), we identified very few RCTs on pharmacological treatment with an antidepressant, an antipsychotic or the combination of an antidepressant with an AP of participants with a major depressive disorder with a current episode with psychotic features (unipolar psychotic depression).</P>
<P>In addition to nine studies, whose main focus was the treatment of participants with psychotic depression, we were able to find three studies that reported separately on the effects of the subgroups of participants with psychotic depression. The authors of two further studies provided us with additional information on the results for the subgroup of psychotically depressed participants in their studies on both psychotic and non-psychotic depressed patients. In our previous review, we invited authors of several studies to provide us with subgroup data if available, so we could use these data in our review, but we did not receive any data.</P>
<P>In this update, we found two new studies to be added to the ten studies found in our previous review, which (again) illustrates that this most severe form of depression is highly under-investigated. One probable reason for this is that it is very difficult to conduct RCTs in patients with psychotic depression. These patients often are not only psychotic but are very anxious or physically ill. Moreover, they are often offered ECT directly without a trial of pharmacological treatment. Finally, many patients with psychotic depression are not able or are reluctant to give informed consent, or they tend to withdraw their consent.</P>
<P>As a result of the paucity of RCTs, few clinically relevant conclusions can be drawn.</P>
<SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS MODIFIED="2015-07-09 13:42:45 +0100" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>1. Evidence was derived from two identical placebo-controlled studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>) for the efficacy of the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic (fluoxetine plus olanzapine vs placebo; RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.82, P = 0.003)</P>
<P>2. We found evidence that the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic is more effective than antidepressant monotherapy. Pooling of four studies (five comparisons) that compared the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic with antidepressant monotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Anton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-007.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 7.1</LINK>) results in a significant difference favouring the combination (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.80, P = 0.002). When the two comparisons with a different antidepressant are left out (<LINK REF="STD-Anton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>), this difference still is statistically significant (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>; RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.43, P = 0.003). In our previous review, based on two studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1988</LINK>; RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.41), no such proof was found. Therefore, it can be concluded that the recommendation in the APA guidelines (<LINK REF="REF-APA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2010</LINK>) that in psychotic depression the combination should be preferred over an AD alone can be considered evidence based.</P>
<P>3. The combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic is more effective than antipsychotic monotherapy. Pooling of four studies that compared the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic with antipsychotic monotherapy (<LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.1</LINK>) shows a difference favouring the combination (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.38, P = 0.00001). This confirms the conclusion stated in our previous review based on three of these four studies (<LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>).</P>
<P>4. No randomised controlled data are available to lead to the conclusion that an antidepressant alone is efficacious in the treatment of psychotic depression. Only one small study compared monotherapy with an antidepressant (amitriptyline) with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-001.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 1.1</LINK>) and reported no difference (RR 8.40, 95% CI 0.50 to 142.27).</P>
<P>5. No randomised controlled data are available to lead to the conclusion that an antipsychotic alone is efficacious in the treatment of psychotic depression. Two studies compared monotherapy with an antipsychotic (olanzapine) with placebo (<LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>). Pooling of these two studies does not reveal a difference (<LINK REF="CMP-002.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.1</LINK>; RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.73).</P>
<P>6. We were not able to collect data on prior treatments. So we could not address the second objective of our review: to assess whether differences in response to treatment in the current episode would be related to non-response to prior treatment(s).</P>
<P>7. Regarding acceptability of treatment (dropout, adverse effects) and quality of life, we were able to collect data only on overall dropout. In all studies except the study of <LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>, no differences in overall dropout rates were reported between any of the treatment groups, neither in individual studies nor after pooling of studies. With this rather rough measure, we did not find overall differences in overall acceptability of treatments. In the study of <LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>, fewer dropouts were reported in the group treated with the combination of olanzapine plus sertraline than in the group treated with olanzapine alone (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.88). The authors suggest that higher attrition rates among participants treated with olanzapine plus sertraline may be attributable to insufficient response in the olanzapine-treated group.</P>
<P>8. We only found indication of heterogeneity drop-out data in instances where the two identical studies of Rothschild (<LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>)  were included (<LINK REF="CMP-002.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 2.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.2</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-006.02" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 6.2</LINK>). This heterogeneity probably is due to high dropout rates, together with differences in dropout rates between the two studies.</P>
</SUMMARY_OF_RESULTS>
<APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS MODIFIED="2013-11-01 10:06:39 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne ">
<P>Our conclusions are based on only 12 studies that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Moreover, in the included studies, only a few different antidepressants and antipsychotics were used. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the above conclusions can be extrapolated to other antidepressants and antipsychotics. Strictly spoken, evidence that the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic is more effective than an antidepressant alone in an RCT has been obtained only for the combination of venlafaxine and quetiapine compared with venlafaxine (<LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>), although evidence that the combination of an antidepressant plus an antipsychotic is more effective than an antipsychotic alone has been obtained in RCTs for only two antipsychotics: the combination of amitriptyline and perphenazine reported as more effective than perphenazine (<LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>); all three other studies involved combinations with olanzapine: in two studies with fluoxetine (<LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>) and in one study with sertraline (<LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>).</P>
<P>Nearly all participants in these studies were inpatients. This of course is a consequence of the severity of the illness and the fact that in clinical practice, most patients with psychotic depression are treated as inpatients. There is also the problem of patients who were not included in the studies: the most severely ill patients who were not able to give informed consent or who were immediately given ECT. All these points limit the generalisability of the results to all patients with psychotic depression.</P>
<P>These problems with the quality of diagnostic assessment can restrict generalisation of the findings to all patients with psychotic depression, leaving aside the problem of establishing the diagnosis of psychotic depression in clinical reality.</P>
</APPLICABILITY_OF_FINDINGS>
<QUALITY_OF_EVIDENCE MODIFIED="2013-11-01 12:03:41 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne ">
<P>The strength of this review and its conclusion is that only randomised controlled studies have been included, and only ITT data have been used in the analyses.</P>
<P>Several factors limit our confidence in the findings of this review.</P>
<P>Most studies were relatively small. Only four RCTs had a more or less adequate sample size: <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>: with olanzapine 48 and 53 participants, with placebo 51 and 49 participants, but only 25 and 23 olanzapine plus fluoxetine, respectively; <LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>: with olanzapine + sertraline 129 and sertraline 130 participants; and <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>: imipramine 42, venlafaxine 39 and venlafaxine + quetiapine 41 participants. As with all systematic reviews, publication bias is a potentially serious source of bias. Too few studies were identified to allow further investigation into the possibility of publication bias (e.g. by making funnel plots). However, the fact that in these mostly small trials, five (50%) found a significant difference between two active treatments, is suggestive of publication bias.</P>
<P>Allocation concealment, especially in the older studies, was not explicitly described. Although we do not assume allocation concealment to be a real bias, this is of course unsure.</P>
<P>Dosages of antidepressants and antipsychotics used in the different trials were considered reasonably adequate. However, differences in dosing strategies were noted, leading to possible bias. Differences in additional medication strategies and differences in treatment periods were also reported (see paragraph 'Other potential sources of bias').</P>
<P>We could use only one outcome measure regarding efficacy: the response rates as defined by the authors. It was impossible to recalculate these response rates into a standard response rate based on a single definition (e.g. reduction on the HRSD-17 of at least 50% compared with baseline), as many studies used other versions of the HRSD. Moreover, some studies used response definitions that are commonly used for the definition of remission, and we could not recalculate the results to the more commonly used definition of response (i.e. reduction of 50% compared with baseline).</P>
<P>We cannot rule out the possibility of differences in the diagnostic assessment of participants and thus in the quality of the diagnosis across the studies. Although it was reported in all publications that participants included in the trials fulfilled criteria for a major depressive episode with psychotic features, according to a specified diagnostic classification system (RDC, <I>DSM-III</I> or <I>DSM-IV</I>), one could doubt the reliability of the diagnoses made in some trials. Six studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Broek-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van den Broek 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>) used a semi-structured interview, and only three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>) reported the types of psychotic features. This leaves open the possibility that for instance the judgement that a feeling or idea of guilt was a guilt delusion was drawn differently across the studies in this review. A similar diagnostic problem may have played a role in the judgement of whether a participant had a psychotic depression in the course of unipolar disorder or bipolar disorder. Finally, the study of <LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK> included a geriatric sample with a mean age of 72 years, leading to the possibility that dementia or another neurological disorder was part of the diagnosis in some participants.</P>

<POTENTIAL_BIASES MODIFIED="2013-11-01 12:15:10 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="[Empty name]">
<P>One problem is that there does not exist a key word (Mesh Term) for psychotic depression. Therefore, we had to search all RCTs involving depression on whether included participants had depression with psychotic features, or whether such participants had been part of the group of included participants and were reported as a separate subgroup. We anticipated in the first version of this review that we might have missed one or more studies. However, we did not receive any information that we had missed any study. Therefore, in this update, we are now rather sure that we indeed have included all existing studies.</P>
<P>In three studies (<LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-van-den-Broek-2004a" TYPE="REFERENCE">van den Broek 2004a</LINK>), the subgroup of psychotic depressed participants was part of a greater group of participants with psychotic and non-psychotic depression, although the subgroups were not stratified before random assignment.</P>
<P>Another potential problem, which was not taken into account in our a priori protocol before this systematic review was performed, is that in five studies, the response definition included response with regard to psychotic symptoms (<LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-2000" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 2000</LINK>), although in the other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Anton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Bruijn-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Bruijn 1996</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1988" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1988</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-van-den-Broek-2004" TYPE="STUDY">van den Broek 2004</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Zanardi-1996" TYPE="STUDY">Zanardi 1996</LINK>), response rates concerned only change in severity of depression. In our analysis, we looked only for the response of depression, leading to a possible bias favouring antidepressants over antipsychotics.</P>
</POTENTIAL_BIASES>
<AGREEMENT MODIFIED="2013-11-03 15:07:47 +0000" MODIFIED_BY="Anne ">
<P>In a review of practice guidelines regarding the treatment of psychotic depression (<LINK REF="REF-Wijkstra-2007" TYPE="REFERENCE">Wijkstra 2007</LINK>), we found different recommendations based on slightly different studies, mostly not reanalyzed. Two guidelines&#8212;Nice 2004 and the Dutch guideline 2005 (now updated with no changes regarding treatment of psychotic depression: <LINK REF="REF-Dutch-Guideline-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">Dutch Guideline 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="REF-NICE-2009" TYPE="REFERENCE">NICE 2009</LINK>)&#8212;were cautious in their recommendations. Nice 2004: Augmenting an AD with an AP should be considered; and Dutch 2005: Starting treatment with a TCA and if after 4 weeks there is still no response, adding an AP is a reasonable option; starting with the combination of a TCA and an AP is also a reasonable option. The other reviewed guidelines, including the APA guideline 2000 (now updated with no differences regarding the treatment of psychotic depression; <LINK REF="REF-APA-2010" TYPE="REFERENCE">APA 2010</LINK>), recommend using the combination of an AD and an AP. None of these guidelines recommended monotherapy with an antipsychotic. These recommendations were not based on a systematic review of data from all available RCTs; they were based on a few studies&#8212;some randomised and some open non-randomised. Another meta-analysis on the treatment of psychotic depression has been published (<LINK REF="REF-Farahani-2012" TYPE="REFERENCE">Farahani 2012</LINK>). This review and meta-analysis is focused on the comparison of antidepressant or antipsychotic monotherapy with combination treatment. Five studies were included (<LINK REF="STD-Anton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 1990</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-K_x00fc_nzel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Künzel 2008</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>). In our review, for this particular comparison, we excluded <LINK REF="STD-K_x00fc_nzel-2008" TYPE="STUDY">Künzel 2008</LINK> because it is unclear whether less or more than 20% of included participants in the ITT group had a bipolar disorder (see table <LINK TAG="EXCLUDED_STUDIES_DESCR" TYPE="SECTION">Excluded studies</LINK>), and we did not use the study of <LINK REF="STD-Anton-1990" TYPE="STUDY">Anton 1990</LINK> because we did not regard amoxapine as an antidepressant (<LINK REF="CMP-008.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 8.1</LINK>). We included in our review the same three other studies (<LINK REF="STD-Mulsant-2001" TYPE="STUDY">Mulsant 2001</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Wijkstra-2010" TYPE="STUDY">Wijkstra 2010</LINK>), using exactly the same extracted ITT data. The conclusion of this review is consistent with ours: Combination treatment is more effective than antidepressant monotherapy. For the comparison of an antipsychotic plus an antidepressant versus an antipsychotic, the same four studies with again exactly the same extracted ITT data were included (<LINK REF="STD-Meyers-2009" TYPE="STUDY">Meyers 2009</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004a" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004a</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Rothschild-2004b" TYPE="STUDY">Rothschild 2004b</LINK>; <LINK REF="STD-Spiker-1985" TYPE="STUDY">Spiker 1985</LINK>; <LINK REF="CMP-005.01" TYPE="ANALYSIS">Analysis 5.1</LINK>), leading in both reviews to the same conclusion: Combination treatment is more effective than antipsychotic monotherapy. As in our review, no differences were reported in overall dropout rates across all studies for both comparisons.</P>

<P>We found a possible error in the review 'Pharmacological treatment for psychotic depression' by Wijkstra J, Lijmer J, Burger H, Geddes J, Nolen WA., which was published in issue 11 of year 2013.</P>
<P>When we read through the review, we found that they included 2 comparisons from a single article to calculate clinical outcome in their Analysis 7. The referenced article was Wijkstra 2010, in which 122 patients were randomized into 3 treatment groups; imipramine (n=42), venlafaxine (n=39) or venlafaxine + quetiapine (n=41). In their Analysis 7, they compared imipramine or venlafaxine group against venlafaxine + quetiapine group independently in each subgroup. Then, when they conducted the analysis for the Total, venlafaxine + quetiapine group (n=41) was included twice in the "antidepressant plus antipsychotic" group.</P>
<P>Double counting the same subjects would spuriously increase precision in the meta-analytic estimates. Authors should use a proper method to avoid double-counting the same subjects.</P>

<P>We would like to thank Dr Matsuo and his colleagues for pointing out this mistake in the original analysis. We looked at this and we agreed that the best approach is probably to split the comparator (as described in the Cochrane Handbook, chapter 16.5.4). We amended the analyses in the revised review accordingly and, given the numbers involved, it makes no material difference to the point estimates or precision. The revised estimate for clinical response (see Analysis 7.1) was: RR 1.42; 95% CI 1.11 to 1.81 (while the original pooled RR was 1.44 with a 95% CI 1.15 to 1.80). The revised estimate for dropouts (see Analysis 7.2) was: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.50 (the original pooled RR was 0.91, with a 95% CI 0.58 to 1.44).</P>
<P>We thank the EBMH Study Group for their interest and close reading of our review.</P>
